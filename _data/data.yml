        My favourite course was probably Calculus by Liivi Kluge, very thorough explanations and practice sessions after which you felt like you understood a lot of arcane stuff.
        Logical Programming by JÃ¼ri Vain was cool too. Had to develop an unusual way of thinking to use Prolog efficienly. 
        Also enjoyed taking part in programming competitions thanks to the Ago Luberg.
