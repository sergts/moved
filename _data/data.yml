        My favourite course was probably Calculus by Liivi Kluge - very thorough explanations and practice sessions after which you felt like you finally understood a lot of arcane stuff.
        Logical Programming by JÃ¼ri Vain was cool too. Using Prolog definitely required an unusual way of thinking about programming. 
        Also enjoyed taking part in programming competitions thanks to the Ago Luberg.
